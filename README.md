mctop
=====

A top-like command line app for monitoring memcached. This is a very rough first version which does,
though, provide usable output:

```
              Efficiency   Requests
Interval:          20.0%          5
Cumulative:        29.4%         17
Total:              3.6%    538,225
```


To Do
-----

Look into using [Urwid](http://excess.org/urwid/examples.html) for screen, colors, and font control. Also, [pythondialog](http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/) might come in handy. Also, [blessings](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessings/).
