mctop
=====

A top-like command line app for monitoring memcached. This is a very rough first version which does,
though, provide usable output:

```
Efficiency
  Interval:      31.2 %
  Cumulative:    18.9 %
Requests
  Interval:      16
  Cumulative:   111
```


To Do
-----

Look into using [Urwid](http://excess.org/urwid/examples.html) for screen, colors, and font control. Also, [pythondialog](http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/) might come in handy.
